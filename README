Hello, World
============

This repository will be used to deliver PAC 2 of IoT Development course.

We will:
- Create an initial tag 0.9
- Create branch 'portingpython3' to work on the changes to make it work with Python3
- Create branch 'idiomaticpython' to make some changes in the code
- Merge both branches and create a new tag 1.0
